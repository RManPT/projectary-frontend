# projectary-frontend

The frontend part of the projectary project.

## Installation
The only dependency is NodeJS, so just run `npm install` inside this repo:

```bash
$ cd \projectary-frontend
$ npm install 
```

## Usage
We need to start a server running [the API](https://github.com/iptomar/projectary-api). Grab it, install it and run it. If you need to change the IP where the API is located just change the configuration which is located at `src/main.ts`.

### Development
To run our project in development mode do `npm run start`. After that you need to open your browser on the indicated address.

### Production
To build it you just need to do `npm run build` and it will build the files at `/dist`. Just launch the index.html in your browser.
